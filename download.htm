          <h2>01. WHAT I DID</h2>
          <p>The aim of our project was to redesign an existing non-profit website called Rugby Foodbank. We chose this website because it is local to us and serves the local community. However, it was evident that the website desperately needed modernisation.
          </p>
          <p>The problem stemmed from the website&#39;s existing layout which made it hard to find information for contributions, and the outdated design didn&#39;t engage users visually.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="m_the-process">
          <h2>02. THE PROCESS</h2>
          <p> We started off by creating a proto-persona based on our assumptions. Initially, we thought the user could be a single mother facing financial difficulties and who goes to the website for help.
          </p>
          <p> After analysing our date gathered from 4 user intervies, we created a user persona called Sam, who is eager to make a donation. This helped to visually represent our target users and understand their needs.</p></section>
        <p>As well as creating a user scenario, we made a user journey map to discover opportunities for improvement as Sam completes his goal of donating food. </p>

          <p>After conducting 4 user interviews, we discovered that most users go onto the site to give help instead of to get help so we decided to focus on those users instead.
            Upon analyzing insights we discovered several user pain points including, confusing images in the hero section and inconsistency in button design.
            </p>
          <p>We conducted a heuristic evaluation to help us identify further usability issues and found inconsistent call-to-action buttons, confusing users who only want to donate food.</p>
        <p>Finally, we looked into different solutions that would improve the overall design of the website by completing a competitor analysis based on researching 3 direct and non-direct companies involved in charitable aid.
          <img alt="">
          <p>We created an Empathy Map to reveal any weaknesses in our existing user research data by removing bias from our designs and align the team on a single, shared understanding of the user.</p>

          <p>Overall, we have redesigned the Rugby Foodbank website by improving the design consistency, user engagement and experience. After several iterations, we have a user-friendly design that will help users like Sam to easily navigate and complete their goals. </p>
          <p>If we had more time, we would work on improving the “get help” feature as that would cater to a larger audience who would go on to the site to find help. We would also spend more time developing the design of other pages on the site to improve the overall site experience.
